    expand</summary>\n\n  - **Appliance Trigger:**\n      - Enter the power sensor
    entity that measures the live current draw of the appliance. Common devices with
    these sensors include smart plugs, energy meters, etc.\n      - The automation
    is triggered when the appliance's current draw exceeds a set wattage.\n      -
    The automation ends when the appliance's current draw falls below a set value.\n\n
    \ - **Notification Options:**\n      - Send notification messages to one or multiple
    devices when the appliance starts and/or finishes.\n      - Your end message can
    include estimates of total power consumption and cost.\n      - Notifications
    are compatible with both Apple iOS and Android devices, ensuring universal accessibility.\n\n
    \ - **Power Tracking:**\n      - Utilize power tracking for estimating total power
    consumption and cost. \n      \n      ⚠️ **Disclaimer** - These values are estimates
    and should only be used as a guide. Please avoid relying solely on these estimates
    for accuracy and use them at your own risk. We cannot be held responsible for
    any inaccuracies or resulting losses, damages, inconvenience, or anything else
    that may occur.\n\n  - **Custom Actions:**\n      - Tailor custom actions to suit
    your preferences and needs, enhancing the automation's functionality.\n      -
    Configure actions such as triggering announcements on platforms like The Voice
    (HA), Google, Alexa, etc., to keep you informed about appliance events.\n\n  -
    **Time-Based Automation:**\n      - Specify precise start and end times along
    with weekday selections to define when the automation can run.\n\n  - **Custom
    Conditions:**\n      - Enter any custom conditions to further customize the automation
    process.\n</details>\n\nNeed help? See our FAQ: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/650166/2)\nLet

      description: Please enter the power sensor entity that measures the live current
        draw of the appliance. Common devices that have these sensors include smart
        plugs. This sensor is essential for triggering the automation when the appliance
        starts and when it finishes.
